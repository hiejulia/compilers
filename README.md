### Java compiler 
+ 




### JVM 
+ Container aware Java 
+ Extended language with more language features (e.g., arrays) for use in ambitious courses.•JVM target for building a compiler that generates code for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).•Optimizer component and assignment for teaching code optimization.•Interpreter component and assignment for teaching program interpretation.•Alternate build process for building the toolset via Ant [4], in addition to Make [3], en-abling students and instructors to install the toolset on non-Unix platforms such as Windows.
+ Enable execution of Java on GPU 
    + Java Stream API - Lambda - exploit processing power of GPU 
    + 
+ GC 
    + memory allocation 
    + 
+ Core component : 
    + Lexer, Parser, Constrainer, Interpreter, Compiler, VM, Debugger, Lexical analysis, Build Abstract syntax, type checking, 
+ Lexx/ Parse generator : JavaCC, JLex, Cup 
+ Build : Make, Ant
+ Advancd : Optimizer, Interpreter 
+ Some proposal 
    + JVM access check 
    + Value objects 
    + Diagnostic command framework 
    + Low overhead way of sampling Java heap allocation 
    + Concurrent monitor delfation 
    + 
+ JVM Tools Interface   
    + Adding patch points or method entry and exit 
    + Enum of compiled methods 
    + State changed notifications and compiled method load 
    + Query support 
    + Chunks of compiled methods 

+ Concurrent JVM 
    + access object 
    + 
+ Lexical issue : + Symbol table (token)
+ Scanner 
+ Dataflow analysis 
+ Program optimization 
+ Code generation 
+ Runtime system
